# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We currently support the `main` branch. No backports are guaranteed.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do not open public issues for security vulnerabilities.

- Use GitHub Security Advisories (Private Vulnerability Reporting) to report sensitive issues.
- Provide as much detail as possible, including reproduction steps and impacted components.
- We will review reports on a best-effort basis. There is no SLA or guarantee of response.

Thank you for helping keep this project secure.
